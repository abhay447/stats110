# Statistics 110

This is just a simple collection of simulations of various interesting probelms discussed by Joseph Blitzstein in Statistics110@havard.

I think I needed these programs because although I understood the mathematics behind the solutions but I couldn't just convince myself with proofs
alone, thus I took the simulation way.

## Problems
 - Birthday Problem
    1. Run birthdayProblem.cpp in a c++ compiler of your choice
    2. This would generate a csv file of population vs coincidences
    3. Run birthday_plot.py to generate the graph from the csv file

 - Monty Hall Problem
    1. We have coded a generic version of the monty hall problem, You can run it in C++ compiler of your choice

 - Expectation of a Geometric Distribution
    1. Run on c++ compiler of your choice
    2. The program assumes a random value of probability of success of a single trial and then carries out multiple simulationson it.
